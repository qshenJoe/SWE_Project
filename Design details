The design process is divided into mainly two parts: database design and user interface design.

In database design, we first create tables based on levels of difficulty, which is corresponding to the length of each word of its category.

In user interface design, we plan to design two panels, one is the main panel for selecting difficulties, and another is for users to unscramble words. For a better user experience, we will simplify the main panel, which is easy for children to manipulate-they can start with level they choose within a simple click on the level button. In the answering panel, there will be a timer and attempts counter, which form a score system deciding if the user can move on to next levels. 

In addition, there are three unlocked levels designed as primary levels for users to play, and users cannot go to advanced levels without getting enough scores.
