It's an unscramble word game

Below is the project proposal

Proposal
I.Background

	Nowadays various applications show up everyday, either on a laptop or a smart phone. To make full use of such a convenient technology, we are intended to make a combination of education and entertainment, to design a software which is a kind of unscrambling word game, to educate children under a certain age. 

II.Technologies

	Programming language: Java
	IDE: Eclipse
	Database:MySQL

III.Design steps

	The design process is divided into mainly two parts: database design and user interface design.
	In database design, we first create tables based on levels of difficulty, which is corresponding to the length of each word of its category.
	In user interface design, we plan to design two panels, one is the main panel for selecting difficulties, and another is for users to unscramble words. For a better user experience, we will simplify the main panel, which is easy for children to manipulate-they can start with level they choose within a simple click on the level button. In the answering panel, there will be a timer and attempts counter, which form a score system deciding if the user can move on to next levels. 
	In addition, there are three unlocked levels designed as primary levels for users to play, and users cannot go to advanced levels without getting enough scores.
